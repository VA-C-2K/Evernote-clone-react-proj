 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as
 * the resulting version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes
 * have no explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we return an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us the
 * updated version.
 *
 * Note that TransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being
 * applied to a NoDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is
 * because the client always combines the TransformMutation with a SetMutation
 * or PatchMutation and we only want to apply the transform if the prior
 * mutation resulted in a Document (always true for a SetMutation, but not
 * necessarily for a PatchMutation).
 *
 * ## Subclassing Notes
 *
 * Subclasses of Mutation need to implement applyToRemoteDocument() and
 * applyToLocalView() to implement the actual behavior of applying the mutation
 * to some source document.

/**
 * An IndexedDB-backed instance of Persistence. Data is stored persistently
 * across sessions.
 *
 * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence
 * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and
 * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is
 * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke
 * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.
 *
 * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK
 * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick
 * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is
 * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary
 * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to
 * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to
 * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as
 * primary.
 *
 * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only
 * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of
 * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence
 * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see
 * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from
 * persistence.
 *
 * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary
 * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as
 * the addition of new mutations and query targets.
 *
 * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary
 * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent
 * operations will automatically fail.
 *
 * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the
 * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make
 * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary
 * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload
 * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the
 * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a "zombiedClient" entry in
 * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and
 * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.

/**
 * A PersistentStream is an abstract base class that represents a streaming RPC
 * to the Firestore backend. It's built on top of the connections own support
 * for streaming RPCs, and adds several critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
 *   - Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * Subclasses of PersistentStream implement serialization of models to and
 * from the JSON representation of the protocol buffers for a specific
 * streaming RPC.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be start()ed before messages can
 * be sent and received. The PersistentStream will call the onOpen() function
 * of the listener once the stream is ready to accept requests.
 *
 * Should a start() fail, PersistentStream will call the registered onClose()
 * listener with a FirestoreError indicating what went wrong.
 *
 * A PersistentStream can be started and stopped repeatedly.
 *
 * Generic types:
 *  SendType: The type of the outgoing message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ReceiveType: The type of the incoming message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ListenerType: The type of the listener that will be used for callbacks
